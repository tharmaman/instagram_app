# instagram_app

Created an app which mimicked the basic features of instagram which includes a time-sorted news feed consisting of both videos and pictures from a front-end perspective.

On the back end we took into account Instagram messenger (both for individuals and groups), stories, polls, albums, photos, hashtags, locations, videos, company partners, company campaigns and user profiling. Feel free to take a look at the SQL schema! :)

Host a personal using MAMP and fill up the database using the SQL schema. (was unable to do this with the free github website).

Please visit the SQL queries section to view the construction of interesting queries we could think of such as displaying the transcript of the most active group conversation and displaying all male users who like a particular hashtag.
